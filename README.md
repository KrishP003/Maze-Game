# Maze-Game

The Maze Game program is an interactive game that offers users the unique ability to switch between a 2D and 3D game style while playing. The objective of the game is to navigate through a maze and reach the exit as quickly as possible.

In the 2D game mode, the user controls a character represented by a red square icon on a flat maze grid. They can move forward and change directions using the arrow keys on the keyboard. The maze is displayed from a top-down perspective, and the user must carefully maneuver through the maze's twists and turns to find the exit.

To enhance the gaming experience, the program allows users to switch to a 3D game mode. In this mode, the maze is rendered in a three-dimensional space, providing a more immersive and realistic environment. Users can activate the 3D mode and explore the maze from different angles.

One unique feature of the 3D mode is the inclusion of a flashlight. Users can equip and use the flashlight to illuminate their path, allowing them to see further ahead in the maze.
